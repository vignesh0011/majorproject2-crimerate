## Crime Rate Prediction Using Google Maps

The project predicts crime rates using Google Maps data and K-Means clustering. It improves prediction accuracy by analyzing features like points of interest and street layouts. The process involves collecting data, extracting features, clustering, and making predictions. By combining historical crime data with spatial information from Google Maps, the system identifies crime patterns. Various machine learning algorithms, including K-Means, are used to forecast crime rates based on these patterns. Experiments show the system works better than traditional methods. By understanding where crime is likely to happen, law enforcement can take proactive measures, making cities safer for everyone.
## About
This project employs Google Maps data and K-Means clustering to predict crime rates, enhancing accuracy for proactive crime prevention. By examining features such as points of interest and street layouts, it aims to pinpoint potential crime locations in urban areas. The process entails data collection, feature extraction, clustering, and prediction. Historical crime data is merged with Google Maps spatial data, and spatial analysis techniques uncover crime patterns. Utilizing machine learning, especially K-Means, the system forecasts crime rates based on these patterns. Experiments validate its effectiveness, indicating superior performance compared to traditional methods. By revealing crime hotspots, law enforcement can take preventative actions, ultimately ensuring safer cities for residents and visitors. This approach empowers authorities to allocate resources more efficiently, fostering a proactive stance against crime.
## Features
1. Crime Hotspot Detection: Identifies high-crime areas for effective resource allocation and patrol prioritization.
2. Predictive Crime Forecasting: Uses machine learning to predict future crime rates, aiding proactive measures and resource allocation.
3. Customizable Alerts: This enables users to set personalized alerts for specific crime types or areas, facilitating timely responses from law enforcement.
4. Interactive Data Visualization: Provides intuitive visualizations of crime data trends, aiding decision-making and strategic planning.
5. Geographic Risk Assessment: Generates risk reports based on crime data analysis, assisting in targeted interventions and prevention strategies.

## Requirements
* Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge for accessing Google Colab's online platform.
* Python: Ensure Python is installed on your laptop. You can download and install it from the official website.
* Express js: Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js
* Node js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* Stable Internet Connection: Reliable internet access is necessary to use Google Colab effectively.
* Google Maps API Key: Sign in with your Google Cloud Console account to access the Google Maps API key and use that API key in the Maps with the crime dataset
